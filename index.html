                <p>Khushi, these 4 days without you have felt like an eternity. I replay our fight in my mind and realize how much I hurt you. I'm truly sorry for [not cutting off people you didn't like earlier than usual. During all this time, I've been working on so much for you, and I realized I wanted to create the perfect apology—which is why I made this website]. You deserve better, and I want to be that for you.</p>

            <div class="note-part">
                <p>Remember how we always said we'd face everything together? I miss that. I love your kindness, your laugh, and the way you make every moment special. Please give me a chance to make this right.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="note-part">
                <p>These 4 days have been transformative for me. I've done everything I could to work on myself—reflecting on my mistakes, understanding your perspective, and committing to real change. I just want to assure you of peace, and I'm confident that I'll be able to provide that for you now and always.</p>
